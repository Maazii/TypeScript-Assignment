# TypeScript-Assignment
This repository contains the subsmission for the TypeScript Assignment given as part of the coursework for Governor of Sindh's IT Initiative. 45 folders with each folder containing a TypeScript and a JavaScript file. I added the files using git but forgot to place in measures that would ensure serial transmission and thus the folders are not ordered. My apologies.
